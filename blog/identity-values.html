        <h3 style="font-size:3vw;">Who am I and how has my culture influenced me?</h3>
        <h3>21 Apr 2022</h3>
        <p>Kia ora everyone! I am Liam, I am from NZ and I grew up in Auckland. After doing my undergraduate in business at Otago I knew I wanted to pursue a career in the technology space. This took me on an adventure to Silicon Valley where I stumbled upon software engineering. Since then I have worked at a beekeeping startup, a software studio, and now I'm taking my tech skills to the next level at Dev Academy!</p>
        <p>I am excited to build cutting edge technology. Some of humanity's greatest achievements have occurred through this and software engineering plays a large part in building these tools today. The constantly changing environment, ability to bring your ideas to life, and limitless growth potential, is hugely exciting to me. </p>
        
        <h3>My culture and its influence on my values and identity.</h3>
        <p>There are 3 cultures I feel strongly make up my values and identity. Firstly, the New Zealand culture, secondly my family culture, and thirdly human culture more broadly.</p>
        <p>For me, being a kiwi is about being easy going. We don’t tend to make up problems. We go with the flow and be kind to others along the way. We love the outdoors and have an awesome ability to build things ingenuitively. We value family and friends and leave our front door open for anybody with good intentions to come in. As a result I have found it quite easy to interact with other cultures, avoid issues, and enjoy. Avoiding issues can also be bad if it’s done too often on things that don’t go away. I’ve learnt how useful and connecting these issues can be when they’re talked about in the right way. </p>
        <p>In my home growing up, 2 values were strongly installed into me. From my mum, it is the value of positivity and from my dad, the value of doing something you love. My mum sharpened this idea her whole life and there’s something deeper to be understood about it. We all know positivity can improve our happiness. We think about an event and if it was good or bad it doesn’t matter, there is always some positive element that can be drawn from it. That’s straightforward. But having the mindset to look for positivity also helps us have more positive experiences. It’s not just the memory of those experiences that become positive in our minds, it’s the actual experiences in the moment too. We become better at deciding what experiences we want to choose because we are better at noticing positivity. When we have this frame of mind, the moment and the memory become more positive too. This has tremendously shaped my attitude which has helped in past jobs like door to door sales, which I actually really enjoyed (in the moment and upon reflection too haha). The other value my dad taught me is doing something you love. Our lives are short so lets make the most of it and enjoy every minute.</p>
        <p>I am also a human, and I think as a human we have an innate sense of empathy and fairness. I want a world that is fair, where people have access to equal opportunities. A world with unlimited potential for creation. A world full of liberty but also compassion for helping others. I believe humans have the right to be free to make their own choices but this sometimes comes into conflict when someone’s freedom impacts our own, like with vaccines. It’s so interesting when our values clash, I guess they don’t define us perfectly. There’s weights to them. Spectrums and contradictions.</p>
        
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <li>Great at working with people. I really enjoy relationships.</li>
        <li>Perseverant, I embrace a positive mindset. I am good at finding things out, tinkering until I get a solution, and then asking for help if I don’t. It also helps me to stay on task unsupervised. Eg. I started a sales business at Uni working with a friend.</li>
        <li>I am fit, physically and mentally and constantly challenge myself to grow in both aspects.</li>
        <li>Life long learner. I enjoy learning new things and I am confident in my ability to grasp difficult concepts, like econometrics for example.</li>
        <li>I am very good at creating opportunities. </li>
        
        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
        <li>Self belief/less self doubt is a core skill I would like to develop more of/ have consistency over/ can get it back on track when I notice it veering.</li>
        <li>Being technically ready for an opportunity.</li>

        <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
        <li>I am confident in my ability at making opportunities but in the past I've found I have not been technically ready. I need to develop more of my technical skills and self belief to complete the equation.</li>
        <li>My ability to learn concepts will be very useful for developing technical skills.</li>
        <li>My ability to persevere and embrace a positive mindset will help increase self belief. </li>
        
        <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
        <p>While I was at 42 Silicon Valley, a friend of mine often distracted me and others when we were trying to work. I took him aside and had a serious conversation about how they were affecting our potential to learn and they became less and less distracting from then onwards. Although I handled this well, I think I'd make more of an effort to understand why they were behaving like this and how I could help.</p>
