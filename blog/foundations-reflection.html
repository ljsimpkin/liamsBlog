    <h2>Foundations Reflections</h2>
    <h3>15 May 2022</h3>

    <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
    <p>My mindset is constantly changing in part by thinking and to a great extent by doing. I found the doing part of writing code and helping other students greatly improved my confidence. Thinking, planning, and reflecting on what I learnt and how I learnt
        it, was a really useful tool for making better learning decisions the next day. </p>

    <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming? </h3>
    <p>Values are strongly motivational, they can help us prioritise what's important to us. Empathy is really important for working with others as it helps me understand someone’s point of view. Self empathy is also important, giving yourself space to discover
        the solution instead of getting frustrated, being curious. Self awareness is important for realising these tendencies, the things that trigger them, and resolving them before they have make us feel bad or even better doing so in a preventative
        manner.

    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
    <p>How much there is to learn about yourself. It is infinite!</p>

    <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
    <p>Finding out when to stop, to move onto the next thing. Perhaps the biggest challenge is asking yourself the right question.</p>

    <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
    <p>Computer programming can quickly become frustrating when somebody doesn’t have the right frame of mind. It takes a lot of time and practice before we have the ability to program so understanding how our minds tackle these challenges helps to build
        resilience, turn frustration into curiosity, and have the tools to shape our minds to be the best we can be. It also is a really useful way to consider the bigger picture and work towards building a future we want.</p>

    <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
    <p>The time during core was really useful to me. It helped me get in the right frame of mind for coding. Admittedly, I found some of it easy. I had previous experience with some things. However, going over the basics really helped me fill in some gaps
        and get back into the flow of writing code. I found myself really enjoying building websites from scratch again and going down my own rabbit holes like with git and how to go back to previous versions and javascript hashmaps which are awesome!</p>
