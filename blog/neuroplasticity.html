    <h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindsets</h2>
    <h3>2 May 2022</h3>

    <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
    <p>
        What is it? Neuro = brain plasticity = the quality of being easily molded. Neuroplasticity is the idea that our brains are easily molded, capable of continuously making new structures. In the past, it was believed that our brains remain fixed for most
        of our adult life.
    </p>

        This is a hugely important concept because it means you have the power to change your brain today. Our lives are constantly changing, they are not fixed. You can shape them in positive and negative ways.

        improve.

    <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
    <p>A growth mindset is a mindset that everything is possible, where you thrive on challenges, and failure doesn’t define your ability but instead creates an opportunity to grow and learn.</p>
    <p>Framing missed opportunities as “not yet” helps us create create a growth mindset. Checkout the power of yet <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve#t-459099">here</a>.</p>
