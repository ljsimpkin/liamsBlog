    <h2>My Learning Plan</h2>
    <h3>16 May 2022</h3>
    <h4>My goal: To work as a software engineer</h4>
    <p>I am excited to build cutting edge technology. Some of humanity's greatest achievements have occurred through technological innovation and software engineering is one of the most essential skills we have for making those discoveries today. The constantly
        changing environment, ability to bring your ideas to life, and limitless growth potential, is hugely exhilarating. One area, in particular, I'm interested in is ML. I’m fascinated by the ways we can create value from timely data like building
        apps that identify bird species through their song calls, or whales halfway across the ocean. There are also neat apps like Seek that help you identify plants with a live photo, some that detect the slightest anomaly on an assembly line, and others
        that can diagnose cancers like melanoma.</p>

    <h3>Strengths</h3>
    <li>Great at working with people. I really enjoy relationships.</li>
    <li>Perseverant, I embrace a positive mindset. I am good at finding things out, tinkering until I get a solution, and then asking for help if I don’t. It also helps me to stay on task unsupervised. Eg. I started a sales business at Uni working with a
        friend.
    </li>
    <li>I am fit, physically and mentally and constantly challenge myself to grow in both aspects.</li>
    <li>Life long learner. I enjoy learning new things and I am confident in my ability to grasp difficult concepts, like econometrics for example.</li>
    <li>I am very good at creating opportunities. </li>
    <li><b>Attention to detail</b></li>

    <p>Throughout all my experience tiling, painting, and fixing things, attention to detail has played a major part in my success in these areas. I enjoy going into detail when making things and I take enormous satisfaction when a project is completed to
        these standards.
    </p>

    <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
    <li>Self belief/less self doubt is a core skill I would like to develop more of/ have consistency over/ can get it back on track when I notice it veering.</li>
    <li>Being technically ready for an opportunity.</li>
    <li><b>Over Optimizing</b></li>


    <p>I’ve found myself over-optimizing some things when it’s better to make a quick decision. Like which gym to sign up to, or phone to choose, these decisions were scrutinised squeezing marginal gains. I did make some great decisions tho, but making these
        decisions has freed space for even greater decisions, like which cross fit classes to do, or what goals I should focus on with my coach which were made without over optimising. I am finding out there’s a healthy balance to also benefit hugely
        from iterating quickly.</p>

    <h3>Non-technical skills to develop</h3>
    <p>Meditation</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp expectations from the team</h3>
    <p>My only real expectation is for us all to help create a positive environment for everyone.
        <br><br> Career support would be really useful too. I’d really like to make the process of finding jobs fun and continue deepening these conversations about career plans.
    </p>

    <h3>Personal expectiations</h3>

    <p>I expect to confront being stuck with curiosity instead of frustration, and to know when I should take a break.
        <br><br> I expect to be effective with my time, work when I have energy, and rest when I don’t.
