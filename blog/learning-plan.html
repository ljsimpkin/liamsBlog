      <h2>My Learning Plan</h2>
      <h3>20 Apr 2022</h3>
      <h3 >My goal is to work in the product development space, building technology, and to help manage the business and people’s interests.</h3>
      <h3 >My goal at Dev Academy is to develop software skills for building technology.</h3>
      <h3 style="color:black">My future goal is to invest in startups.</h3>
      <p>I am quite inspired by the technology space, building tools, that sort of thing. I would love to help with the creation of technology companies and their products. Software engineering is a fun and common element of most new technologies. It teaches you how to problem solve and has unlimited potential for scale. On more of an intrinsic level, I enjoy the ability to be able to build things. It’s awesome getting excited by an idea and knowing you have the capability to bring it into the world. When I was younger, I loved playing with lego and it’s a similar feeling I get when I build something with software.</p>
      <p>I believe I have what it takes. I am great at learning new things and motivated by the topic. My weakness is self doubt. I would like to develop more mindful skills. To be calm, present, and prevent my mind from wandering off track.</p>
      <p>My commitment is this. I stand for many of the core values Dev Academy has; I strive to create a positive environment and be kind and patient with others. I will ask for help when I feel stuck/ or when I go over the time I allocate for myself, and take a break to rest when I'm feeling burnt out.</p>
      <p>From the facilitators, I also expect them to strive to create a positive environment and be kind and patient. To be receptive to questions and communicate with ease.</p>
      <p>Thank you!</p>
